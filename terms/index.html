  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <section>
    <strong>1. Using Our Platform</strong><br>
    By using CyberChat or DLSAccounts.Store, you agree to play fair, avoid fraud, and follow all community rules. No spam. No impersonation. No drama.
  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>2. Buying Digital Products</strong><br>
    When you purchase DLS accounts or digital content, you agree that all sales are final unless there is a verified issue. We do not guarantee account performance or in-game rank.

  <section>
    <strong>3. Refunds</strong><br>
    Refunds are only issued if the product cannot be delivered or is proven defective. You must report issues within 7 days of purchase.

  <section>
    <strong>4. Account Access</strong><br>
    Buyers are responsible for securing the login info they receive. Don’t share it publicly. We’re not responsible for losses due to negligence.
  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>5. Termination</strong><br>
    We reserve the right to suspend or ban accounts that violate our rules — no notice needed if you’re caught abusing the system.

    We might update these terms from time to time. We’ll notify you if it’s major.
